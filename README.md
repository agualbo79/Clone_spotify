# ðŸŽ¶Spotify Clone UI
In this project, I aim to create a clone of the Spotify web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to replicate the main features and layout of the Spotify website, allowing users to navigate through playlists, search for music, and play tracks. The project will involve building the user interface with HTML and CSS to match Spotify's design, implementing interactive elements and animations using JavaScript, and incorporating functionalities such as music playback and search functionality. By cloning the Spotify web app, I aim to enhance my front-end development skills and gain a deeper understanding of building complex web applications with modern technologies
